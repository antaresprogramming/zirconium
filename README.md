An opinionated CSS library of components. Offical CSS written by [Francis Rubio](https://github.com/maniczirconium/maniczirconium) for [Antares Programming](https://antaresprogramming.github.io/)

## Goals
- Standardize components for the website
- Support dark mode from the get-go
- Promote accessibility by using HTML structure as basis for styling in some components
