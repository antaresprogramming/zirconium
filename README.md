# Zirconium

An opinionated CSS library of components. Offical CSS written by [Francis Rubio](https://github.com/maniczirconium/maniczirconium) for [Antares Programming](https://antaresprogramming.github.io/)

## Goals
- Standardize components for the website
- Support dark mode from the get-go
- Develop responsiveness
- Promote accessibility by using HTML structure as basis for styling in some components
- Include minimal JavaScript (this is for a blog, not a website)

## How to build the CSS files
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/antaresprogramming/zirconium.git
```

2. Install packages
```bash

```

3. Run the start script

```

After the build finishes, the CSS files and source maps can be accessed inside the `dist/` folder.
